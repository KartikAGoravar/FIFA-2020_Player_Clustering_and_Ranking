# FIFA-2020_Player_Clustering_and_Ranking
This project focused on grouping and ranking FIFA 2020 players based on performance metrics using unsupervised learning. PCA was used for dimensionality reduction, followed by DBSCAN clustering. Outfield players achieved a Silhouette Score of 0.475 and goalkeepers a score of 0.246. Clustering quality was further validated using Calinski-Harabasz and Davies-Bouldin scores. Players were ranked using RMSE and MAE from cluster centroids.
